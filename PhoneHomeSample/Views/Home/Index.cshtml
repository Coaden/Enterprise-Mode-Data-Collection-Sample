                This sample is provided as-is to get you started collecting data about Enterprise Mode for IE11 usage within your organization.
                It is intended to be used as a starting point to building your own data collection solution around Enterprise Mode.
            </p>
            <p>
                To set up data collection, turn on Enterprise Mode logging either through group policy or by directly setting the Enable registry key.
                Set the Enable setting to [deployment url]/api/records/ and data will automatically be sent to this page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main code to implement the API is located inside this project at APIs\RecordsController.cs
            </p>
